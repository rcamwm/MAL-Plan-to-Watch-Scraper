# My Anime List plan-to-watch scraper

A simple webscraper for My Anime List (MAL).  
This program downloads a user's plan-to-watch list into a CSV file along with the anime's community rating.  
Because community ratings don't appear on user anime lists, this is a convenient way to sort the shows you plan to watch from highest rated to lowest rated.

## How to use

Clone this repository onto your local machine and run ```python3 scraper.py [username]``` from the root folder, where `[username]` is the name of the user whose plan-to-watch list you want to download.
